        <p class="about-p">I am a <span>Sitecore Certified Professional Web Developer</span>, and have been developing enterprise solutions using the Sitecore content management system since 2012. I have worked on over ten different Sitecore solutions, ranging from a major travel engine's online booking engine to an internal site for one of the "Big Four" accounting firms, and beyond. An early version of one of my JavaScript plugins (license included) is also visible in the view source of the news site for the <span>Xbox One</span>.</p>

            <p class="about-p">Since 2012, I have been working with responsive design integration, and have experimented with several responsive techniques and tools. I have worked with <span>Twitter Bootstrap</span>, although I prefer to add responsive support manually, whenever possible. I am a very big fan of using media queries on my sites and I strive to design layouts that can easily be optimized for aesthetic appeal on each of desktops, tablets and cell phones. This site uses a responsive design, and I have completed responsive integration throughout most of the site.</p>
